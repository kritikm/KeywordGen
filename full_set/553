 Ho dance not coming courtyard crooked
Eating cake by being stupid 
Buffalo going in the water
गयी भैंस पानी में 
If you tiger, me tiger encounter
If you tiger, me tiger encounter

I am feeling alright
Cause it’s a nonsense ki night
I am feeling alright
Cause it’s a nonsense ki night
I am feeling alright
Cause it’s a nonsense ki night
I am feeling alright
Cause it’s a nonsense ki night

Oh monkey हटा ओ flavour of ginger
अरे flavour of ginger
In the jungle peacock is dancing
Who has in her.. 
Whose is stick his is buffalo
Whose is stick his is buffalo
Whose is stick his is buffalo
But remember hundred of goldsmiths 
Equals one of blacksmith

I am feeling alright
Cause it’s a nonsense ki night
I am feeling alright
Cause it’s a nonsense ki night
I am feeling alright
Cause it’s a nonsense ki night
I am feeling alright
Cause it’s a nonsense ki night

Haaay….

Clouds that make noise 
Don’t rain..
Clouds that make noise 
Don’t rain..
Staying in water don’t be 
Enemy of crocodile
Staying in water don’t be 
Enemy of crocodile
Staying in water don’t be 
Enemy of crocodile
Why??

I am feeling alright
Cause it’s a nonsense ki night
I am feeling alright
Cause it’s a nonsense ki night
I am feeling alright
Cause it’s a nonsense ki night
I am feeling alright
Cause it’s a nonsense ki night
All is in the well if end is in the well
All is in the well if end is in the well
All is in the well if end is in the well
All is in the well if end is in the well
बाक़ी दुनिया go to hell..
